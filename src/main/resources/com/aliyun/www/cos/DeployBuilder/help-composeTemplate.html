<div>
    Default dir is  the workspace of this project. For exmaple, if you just fill in "Compose.yml", Jenkins will use
    ../jobs/${project}/workspace/Compose.yml to deploy your application. So you can upload the compose file to
    directory ../jobs/${project}/workspace.<br />
    Or locate the compose file with yout code package. For example, you can fill in "code/Compose.yml", "code" is your
    code package name.<br />
    Note: DO NOT use '/' at the beginning, just begin with the file name or direcotory name.
